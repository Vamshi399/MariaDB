MariaDB supports different storage engines:
To see which ones are available and supported by your server
which are available, not available, 
or which is currently set to the default. 
The “Support:” column will display ‘YES’, ‘NO’, or ‘DEFAULT’

>show engines;
>use information_schema;
>select table_name,engine from tables;
>select * from engines;

mysql> CREATE TABLE Shared_Data (
    -> Data_ID INTEGER NOT NULL, 
    -> Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, 
    -> Description VARCHAR(150)
    -> ) ENGINE='CSV’;

mysql> INSERT INTO Shared_Data VALUES
    -> (1,’device one’, ‘the latest version of the best tech’),
    -> (2,’device two’, ‘the fastest one on the market’);

Upon success, if you inspect the database directory, there should now be a 
‘Shared_Data.CSV’ file in it that contains the records you have inserted into the Shared_Data table.

#changing storage engine
>ALTER TABLE xyz ENGINE = innodb;

>show plugins;
>select * from plugins;

#shows how much memory is used by the tables and internal buffers.
#performance_schema is not a regular storage engine for storing data, 
it's a mechanism for implementing the Performance Schema feature.
>show engine performance_schema status;
